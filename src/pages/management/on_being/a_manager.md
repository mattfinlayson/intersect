Learning to be a Manager

Understanding Motivation


Modern leadership theory suggests three simple levels: personal, private, and public. Leadership starts on the personal level — learning how to lead yourself. Knowing what drives you, engages you, inspires you to do better. It’s about being self-aware. If you can’t see the path to reaching your full potential, you probably won’t be able to help others reach theirs.

Humans are emotional beings, so passion is a big driver in how we perform. The alternative to passion is discipline, which doesn’t come naturally. Rather it comes through practice. We get better quicker at things we are passionate about. Learn to leverage your passion.

Emotional Intelligence

 The 5 stages of Emotional Intelligence are: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, social skills.

/Self-awareness/ is recognizing when your emotions are influencing your decisions and behavior. Is your heart or your mind in control?
/Self-regulation/ is about managing your state of mind. Being driven by emotion is fine as long as you are still in control and regulating those emotions. It’s ok to exhibit anger as long as you can regulate it.
/Motivating/ yourself is about knowing your wants and needs. Emotions come from the heart, which is a much more powerful motivator than the mind. Understand your motivations and you will become more productive and effective.
/Empathy/ for others is about recognizing and understanding their wants and needs. Lack of empathy can be a source of bias. Figure out what motivates them, and you can help them become more productive and effective.
/Social skills/ are the next step in improving teamwork. In order to help others become self-aware, motivated and empathetic, you’ll need to have good communication and social skills. People won’t choose to follow you unless you have built a relationship with them.

Don’t Pretend
Being a technical manager doesn’t mean you’re the “best developer” any more than being a running coach means you’re the “fastest runner.” The roles are different.
If you’re spending 1:1s simply asking for updates without offering much feedback or coaching, out of a fear that you’ll look inexperienced or lose credibility, then you certainly aren’t going to gain any credibility, let alone add much value.

Welcome the opportunity to learn from senior reports.

As a manager, your role is to maximize the impact of your team.

When interviewing senior candidates, one of the questions we’ll sometimes discuss in a debrief, when making a hiring decision, is “Could I see them becoming my boss some day? Would I work for this person? “ Saying “Yes” in a strong signal this candidate has a ton of value to add to the team.

You don’t have to do everything yourself. You just have to make sure everything gets done.

When you’re not sure ask questions.

You are the sum of the people around you

How to manage up with your Boss


How to manage up with your boss — Quartz at Work
https://qz.com/964501/how-to-manage-up-with-your-boss

The approach was simple. Every Friday afternoon, I’d send my boss a short email with three categories:

The work I had completed that week
What I was working on, including any deadlines that may have shifted or obstacles I’d encountered
What I was waiting on—that is, tasks that I’d completed, but require sign-off from my boss or contributions from someone else

# metrics to track

## Added value

- Number of releases - This would be seen as value for other teams or stakeholders. If we only deliver once per year something must be wrong. Sometimes we do have larger releases, but from my experience having more releases is better
- Number of developers - Well, if we add more developers we should have more output right? We know that it’s not that simple. Tracking this allows us to see the impact of adding or removing people, mostly on the other KPIs
- Developer delta - It’s different having a team of 8 developers during an year that didn’t change, than to always have 8 developers but swapping people. How much the team changes would be tracked here
- Number of bugs in production - Less bugs more added value. Naturally there’s the question of bug severity. Is it that bad to have tons of low priority bugs when we’re focusing on adding value? That’s always a heated debate. This metric will help teams following a zero bug policy

## Pull requests
- Time to close a PR - There are many things that affect the merging of a PR. I’d say that being able to close a PR fast is a good sign. When a developer is waiting for a PR there may be idleness or ping pong or waiting for dependencies
- Time from PR closed to production - When we do merge a PR, how much time does it take to reach production? This can be very fast if we auto deploy on merge, but may be slower if we need a formal QA process.
- Number of comments per PR - This one also affects the time to close a PR. But may add more information to it. If we have lots of comments in average on a PR that is an indicator that something may be wrong. We may have an alignment issue on the team that generates discussions or lots of corrections. This can add to the submitter’s frustration. On the other hand if we have close to zero comments per PR, it may hint that we’re not having PRs deeply reviewed

### Kind of related:

- Pipeline build time - This affects the time to close a PR. Ideally we’d have our feedback instantaneously. If we have a pipeline that takes hours it will impact our productivity. Also interesting would be to see how the build time increases over time, and the impact of adding more developers, more tests, more features, etc
- Number of times master build fails - Having master always green brings confidence to the team and to the process. If on the other hand we have lots of failures, for example because of flaky tests, that will impact our trust and performance


## Infrastructure

- Average downtime - If the application is down, we’re not adding value. We should track this and try to understand what impacts it
- Number of production incidents - How many times we have problems in production that require someone to assess and fix them right away
- Running costs - This could be a whole section by itself, and split in categories like development tooling (build minutes, productivity tools) and environment costs (AWS, services that check for uptime, etc)
- Cost per user - This would be the running cost by the total users/accounts on the system. With this we could forecast what would be our cost if the other teams achieve their target KPIs for new users/accounts
- Sizing - Related to the previous. How much processing power do we need to support the current usage? How much more will we need to support the usage one year from now?
- Performance benchmarks - How much does our system currently endure? For example for a given setup how many transactions per second can we handle? This may harder to track on a KPI
