Learning to be a Manager

Understanding Motivation


Modern leadership theory suggests three simple levels: personal, private, and public. Leadership starts on the personal level — learning how to lead yourself. Knowing what drives you, engages you, inspires you to do better. It’s about being self-aware. If you can’t see the path to reaching your full potential, you probably won’t be able to help others reach theirs.

Humans are emotional beings, so passion is a big driver in how we perform. The alternative to passion is discipline, which doesn’t come naturally. Rather it comes through practice. We get better quicker at things we are passionate about. Learn to leverage your passion.

Emotional Intelligence

 The 5 stages of Emotional Intelligence are: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, social skills.

/Self-awareness/ is recognizing when your emotions are influencing your decisions and behavior. Is your heart or your mind in control?
/Self-regulation/ is about managing your state of mind. Being driven by emotion is fine as long as you are still in control and regulating those emotions. It’s ok to exhibit anger as long as you can regulate it.
/Motivating/ yourself is about knowing your wants and needs. Emotions come from the heart, which is a much more powerful motivator than the mind. Understand your motivations and you will become more productive and effective.
/Empathy/ for others is about recognizing and understanding their wants and needs. Lack of empathy can be a source of bias. Figure out what motivates them, and you can help them become more productive and effective.
/Social skills/ are the next step in improving teamwork. In order to help others become self-aware, motivated and empathetic, you’ll need to have good communication and social skills. People won’t choose to follow you unless you have built a relationship with them.

Don’t Pretend
Being a technical manager doesn’t mean you’re the “best developer” any more than being a running coach means you’re the “fastest runner.” The roles are different.
If you’re spending 1:1s simply asking for updates without offering much feedback or coaching, out of a fear that you’ll look inexperienced or lose credibility, then you certainly aren’t going to gain any credibility, let alone add much value.

Welcome the opportunity to learn from senior reports.

As a manager, your role is to maximize the impact of your team.

When interviewing senior candidates, one of the questions we’ll sometimes discuss in a debrief, when making a hiring decision, is “Could I see them becoming my boss some day? Would I work for this person? “ Saying “Yes” in a strong signal this candidate has a ton of value to add to the team.

You don’t have to do everything yourself. You just have to make sure everything gets done.

When you’re not sure ask questions.

You are the sum of the people around you

How to manage up with your Boss


How to manage up with your boss — Quartz at Work
https://qz.com/964501/how-to-manage-up-with-your-boss

The approach was simple. Every Friday afternoon, I’d send my boss a short email with three categories:

The work I had completed that week
What I was working on, including any deadlines that may have shifted or obstacles I’d encountered
What I was waiting on—that is, tasks that I’d completed, but require sign-off from my boss or contributions from someone else
