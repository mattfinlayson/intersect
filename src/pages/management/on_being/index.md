The approach was simple. Every Friday afternoon, I’d send my boss a short email with three categories:

- The work I had completed that week
- What I was working on, including any deadlines that may have shifted or obstacles I’d encountered
- What I was waiting on—that is, tasks that I’d completed, but require sign-off from my boss or contributions from someone else

Over the years, I refined the practice. I used a timer to ensure that the weekly update would not take longer than 15 minutes to write. I used a simple template where I could pop in information, so as to expedite the process.
