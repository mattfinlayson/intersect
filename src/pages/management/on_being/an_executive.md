# Primary material

- [Your first 90 days as CTO or VP Engineering.](https://lethain.com/first-ninety-days-cto-vpe/) - This is an evergreen post from Will Larson there is lots of useful material here and I won't summerize it. I will call out one detail I see over an over though, talk to everyone. 
- [https://increment.com/teams/how-to-build-a-startup-engineering-team/](https://increment.com/teams/how-to-build-a-startup-engineering-team/) - Solid basics here on building / running a team.


# What do executives do?

> the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.
>
> That's all.
>
> Not to decide. Not to break ties. Not to set strategy. Not to be the expert on every, or any topic. Just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values. And if they do, to endorse it. And if they don't, to send them back to try again.

> It seems too easy to be real. For any disagreement, identify the lead person on each side. Then, identify the lowest executive in the corporate hierarchy that both leads report into (in the extreme case, this is the CEO). Set up a meeting between the three of them. At the meeting, the two leads will present the one, correct decision that they have agreed upon. The executive will sit there, listen, and ratify it. [^1]

# Budgeting 

As an engineering leader you're faced with two 'human capital' measurement problems,
 1. Where is your engineering time going
 2. Why can't you get more done

Having a framework in place prior to challenges gives you and your team agency in the discussion. To drive Strategic Planning, Team Alignment and Prioritization, and Transparency bucket the work into 4 categories:
- Required investments - “minimum tasks to maintain the current level of service in the eyes of our customers”. 
    - Keep the lights on (KTLO) (Note this percentage comes 'off the top' based on the needs and health of your business)
- Elective investments
    - Build new stuff (for customers) ~60% 
    - Improve existing stuff (for customers) ~20%
    - Increase your productivity (not customer visible) ~20%

## Strategic Planning (Annual)

At this level you're looking to align the right balance for the company for the coming year. 
- Discuss previous allocation
- Key points about what got done and what didn't (against goals)
- Propose allocations for the coming year
- Highlight changes

## Group and Team (Quarterly)

To have traction, the framework can’t appear at annual planning and disappear for the rest of the year. Ask teams to report on their allocation across these buckets on a quarterly basis. Collected by engineering directors, expected vs. actual allocation in the previous quarter, and the expectation for next quarter. Read out by Program Management.

# Strategic Planning

As a functional leader you’ll be expected to set your own direction with little direction from others. 
 - When things in your area are going poorly, you’ll be swamped with more direction and input than you can readily absorb 
 - when things are going well, you’ll often be responsible for supplying your own direction and that for your team.

If you don’t supply it yourself, you’ll start to feel the pull of irrelevance: maybe no one really cares what we do? 

Cast a net:
 - Ask folks at your company what their previous companies did well
 - Draw ideas out from your team
 - Read technical papers
 - Meet with peers and ask them what they are doing
 - 

Make time to plan:
* Take care of your own needs
* Make time by choosing not to do some work. Be clear about this choice.
* Block time to do planning, plan for energy, turn off notifications, work offline.

Prompts:
 - Wish list. Make a list of things you’d like to be true in 6, 12, or 24 months. These could be aspects of the team’s process, quality targets, or product capabilities. Then pick one and work backwards to uncover how you might achieve such an outcome.
 - Worry list. Imagine that you quit big picture thinking and make no strategic plans. What are the biggest problems you’ll face in a year?
 - Back to the future. Look back and consider being able to change past decisions and directions. What if we didn’t build X? What do we wish we had done differently? What would you do if you were starting fresh? These can be good clues to explore for shaping the future.
 - 10x. Apply order of magnitude changes as a thinking tool to identify interesting leverage points. What if the service was 10x faster or 10x more efficient? What if we had 10x the traffic, data, or users?

# Layoffs

[How do you handle layoffs on a large scale?](https://medium.com/@eyalmrejen/how-do-you-handle-layoffs-on-a-large-scale-9f513f496659) 
 - this covers critera for selecting who to lay off
 - how to announce to the organizaiton
 - how to think about retention
 - there is also a bit of empathy for having to do the job
