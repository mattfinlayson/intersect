- [Maybe Great](https://noidea.dog/maybe-great/) - This is a great overview of iterating on a process and hits so many of the issues I'v
e experienced while I'm trying to roll one out. Two amazing quotes:
        - “This sounds like EXACTLY the sort of bike shed I should get involved in on my first week in a new company.”
        - Process is only useful if it's useful.

Important notes - this is an exercise in building an agenda. Focus on the questions you're trying to answer and codify them. If you need to make a decision, identify the decision makers, and provide a venue for making the decison. Do not form an elite council that gets to make the decision, use a rotating panel of subject matter experts. Make the notes public if possible.
