> 14. Look for technological sharks
> Old technologies that have stuck around are sharks, not dinosaurs. They solve problems so well that they have survived the rapid changes that occur constantly in the technology world.

These tools won’t be flashy, and they won’t be exciting, but they will get the job done without a lot of sleepless nights.
