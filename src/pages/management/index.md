# Metrics to game


This is one of those it depends questions where the answer is entirely dependent on the engineering team and the behavior you are trying to incentivize. Two things to remember:

1) Engineers will attempt to game all metrics. The classic blunder is to measure number of check-ins. Of course, of course, this means that engineers are going to do MORE CHECK-INS and while this is a measure of productivity for some subset of engineers, it’s TOTALLY THE WRONG MEASURE for a whole slew of others. This leads me to the second point:

2) Think long and hard about what behavior you are looking to incentivize. Another bad behavior metric: mean time to resolve (MTTR). While this is a must watch metric, it’s not a metric you should incentivize against because folks are going to PANIC ABOUT GETTING THE SERVICE UP rather than calmly getting the service up. (edited)

I gamified test coverage at Etsy because it focused our engineers in the direction that mattered


# Nurture Ideas


What I have learnt is that you can get people to share ideas that they have by asking the right questions. Questions that I frequently ask, when we have a problem at hand, are:

    What do you suggest we do?
    What do you think are some ways we can solve it?
    Do you think there is a case where the solution will fail?

Ask these questions, and then pause. Give them time to think. More than that, let silence encourage the other person to speak.

# Dashboards

For me dashboards need to be all of visible, actionable, and used:
 - visible — if you have to go visit a dashboard it’s not a dashboard - the entire point is that it’s something that should be in front of you a lot. That’s not to say visualisations that aren’t always visible are not useful — they’re just not dashboards.
 - actionable — folk can do something with what they’re telling you. Going to fast - so slow down. Below expected target for warm leads - need to invest more effort in sales. etc.
 - used — there’s a culture of actually taking action based on the dashboards. The OKR board is visited in the retros. Folk address the bottleneck in testing that the bursty CFD shows, etc.

If any one of those things is absent - the utility of the dashboard disappears.
 - if it’s not visible then folk don’t notice when Important Thing changes.
 - if it’s not actionable then folk can’t do anything when Important Thing changes.
 - if it’s not used then folk don’t care if Important Thing changes.
