*Behavioral Questions*

Behavioral interview questions task you with describing real situations from the past. These help the employer can get a sense of how you might respond in future situations. Behavioral questions are phrased along the lines of:

Tell me about your most recent group effort.
Describe a situation in which you made a significant impact or demonstrated leadership.
Give me an example of a complex problem you solved and how you accomplished that task. 
Responses to behavioral questions should be specific and structured. When asked about your most recent group work, for example, do not tell the interviewer about your general philosophy of teamwork. Pick a specific team project. Describe the team, the project, how you contributed and the outcome. It is not necessary to offer more than one example.
