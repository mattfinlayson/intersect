title: 1 - 1 Meetings
---

Sometimes people walk in and give me status reports, but that’s not what I want. It’s really about stepping back from all the urgency and having a strategic and interesting conversation. I’m like, “Hey, what’s going on? What’s the hardest thing on your plate right now?” You do this for a year, and people start to depend on that time to share what’s going on, on a more personal level.

Rands Article

Generally I don’t like prescriptive content, he always stereotypes behaviors. When you don’t know a report it can be easy to fall into this.

Playbook

	 - 3 prepared questions
	 - Perf Review

The Vent

The Disaster
