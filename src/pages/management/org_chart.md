Squad - Small cross functional self organizing team, usually less than 8 people. Sit together and have end to end responsibility for the things they build. Design, commit, deploy, maintenance, operations. 

Autonomy means they decide what to build, how to build it, and how to work together. Constrains are mission, product strategy, and short term quarterly goals. 

Upsides are:
Autonomy
Faster decision making
Minimize handoffs and waiting

Loosely coupled, tightly aligned squads. Focused on product delivery and quality.

Tribe is a group of squads that are all aligned to a single area

Chapter is a competency area such as front end development, data science, or operations. Chapter lead is also the line manager focused on coaching and mentoring. This means you can switch squads without getting a new manager. 

Guild informal grouping of cross disciplinary folks focused on a topic. Could have a mailing list, slack group, annual conference.

What are the problems is the structural change going to address:
 - Team contention
 - Reduce handoffs
 - Features are not randomly distributed over the feature teams. The current knowledge and skills of a team are factored into the decision of which team works on which features.

Triage
Staffing and Planning
