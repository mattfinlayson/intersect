title: Supporting People
---


Engineers are having trouble working with you. “If you want specific signals, I’d say people are not taking initiative, there’s retention issues, or people are having trouble working with this person,” Hsu says. What that boils down to is that, for one reason or another, you’re not building trust. Since that’s not a realization most people will voice openly to you, look for feedback in your performance reviews around communication.

## Mentorship

First Discussion Agenda:

1. What are our goals in this mentorship?
2. What will success look like for each of us?
3. How often will we meet? How long are the meetings? For what duration?
4. Should we structure what we will talk about each time?
5. How do you like to communicate?
