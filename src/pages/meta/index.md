In my research for building this it seems these kind of personal wikis go by a number of names (although these aren't all _exactly_ the same thing):

- Digital Garden
- Personal Wiki
- Personal Knowledge Management
- [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)
- [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) a method of note-taking and personal knowledge management used in research and study

I'm not a fan of the "digital garden" metaphor ("plant thought seeds, etc"). If I had to come up with a name I'd be calling it a "brain dump" so don't leave naming things to me.

## What I Hope to Achieve

I've always been someone who likes to archive things (not to the extent of [Jason Scott](https://twitter.com/textfiles), yet) and be able to reference them at a later date. I never had anywhere good to store snippets of code, or a quote I like, or a list of products I recommend. I also plan to go through a 10 year archive of [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) links to build out this site, because I know for a fact there's a lot of good stuff in there.

## Potential Issues

### Link Rot

Link rot is a problem for [a lot of sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot). I've even hit dead links browsing [/r/digitalgardens](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) and most of those links are less than 12 months old. I plan to come up with something to handle this during the build step.

I even came across an article in my Instapaper archive titled "The spread of link rot". The link was dead.

### Organising Topics

- Should [Mac apps](/macos/apps) that are developer tools go in the [development](/webdev) section?
- What about links that cover multiple things?
- Updating and managing the site. I plan to build a CLI/Alfred workflow to help, but what about on iOS?

### Structure

I want to make sure the URLs stay the same forever, which means I need to consider carefully when adding new pages that the page will make sense. [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).
