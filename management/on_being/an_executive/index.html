updated work at different management levels metrics to track added value number of releases this would be seen as value for other teams or stakeholders if we only deliver once per year something must be wrong sometimes we do have larger releases but from my experience having more releases is better number of developers well if we add more developers we should have more output right we know that its not that simple tracking this allows us to see the impact of adding or removing people mostly on the other kpis developer delta its different having a team of 8 developers during an year that didnt change than to always have 8 developers but swapping people how much the team changes would be tracked here number of bugs in production less bugs more added value naturally theres the question of bug severity is it that bad to have tons of low priority bugs when were focusing on adding value thats always a heated debate this metric will help teams following a zero bug policy pull requests time to close a pr there are many things that affect the merging of a pr id say that being able to close a pr fast is a good sign when a developer is waiting for a pr there may be idleness or ping pong or waiting for dependencies time from pr closed to production when we do merge a pr how much time does it take to reach production this can be very fast if we auto deploy on merge but may be slower if we need a formal qa process number of comments per pr this one also affects the time to close a pr but may add more information to it if we have lots of comments in average on a pr that is an indicator that something may be wrong we may have an alignment issue on the team that generates discussions or lots of corrections this can add to the submitters frustration on the other hand if we have close to zero comments per pr it may hint that were not having prs deeply reviewed kind of related pipeline build time this affects the time to close a pr ideally wed have our feedback instantaneously if we have a pipeline that takes hours it will impact our productivity also interesting would be to see how the build time increases over time and the impact of adding more developers more tests more features etc number of times master build fails having master always green brings confidence to the team and to the process if on the other hand we have lots of failures for example because of flaky tests that will impact our trust and performance infrastructure average downtime if the application is down were not adding value we should track this and try to understand what impacts it number of production incidents how many times we have problems in production that require someone to assess and fix them right away running costs this could be a whole section by itself and split in categories like development tooling build minutes productivity tools and environment costs aws services that check for uptime etc cost per user this would be the running cost by the total usersaccounts on the system with this we could forecast what would be our cost if the other teams achieve their target kpis for new usersaccounts sizing related to the previous how much processing power do we need to support the current usage how much more will we need to support the usage one year from now performance benchmarks how much does our system currently endure for example for a given setup how many transactions per second can we handle this may harder to track on a kpi",

will call out one detail i see over an over though talk to everyone  solid basics here on building  running a team what do executives do the job of an executive is to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization and to ratify good decisions thats all not to decide not to break ties not to set strategy not to be the expert on every or any topic just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values and if they do to endorse it and if they dont to send them back to try again theres even an algorithm for this it seems too easy to be real for any disagreement identify the lead person on each side then identify the lowest executive in the corporate hierarchy that both leads report into in the extreme case this is the ceo set up a meeting between the three of them at the meeting the two leads will present the one correct decision that they have agreed upon the executive will sit there listen and ratify it 11what do executives

a framework for balancing and budgeting engineering resourcing strategic planningas a functional leader youll be expected to set your own direction with little direction from others when things in your area are going poorly youll be swamped with more direction and input than you can readily absorb when things are going well youll often be responsible for supplying your own direction and that for your teamif you dont supply it yourself youll start to feel the pull of irrelevance maybe no one really cares what we do cast a net ask folks at your company what their previous companies did well

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lethain.com/first-ninety-days-cto-vpe/">Your first 90 days as CTO or VP Engineering.</a> - This is an evergreen post from Will Larson there is lots of useful material here and I won't summerize it. I will call out one detail I see over an over though, talk to everyone.</li>
<li><a href="https://increment.com/teams/how-to-build-a-startup-engineering-team/">https://increment.com/teams/how-to-build-a-startup-engineering-team/</a> - Solid basics here on building / running a team.</li>

<h1>What do executives do?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>Not to decide. Not to break ties. Not to set strategy. Not to be the expert on every, or any topic. Just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values. And if they do, to endorse it. And if they don't, to send them back to try again.</p>
<p>There's even an algorithm for this.</p>
<p>It seems too easy to be real. For any disagreement, identify the lead person on each side. Then, identify the lowest executive in the corporate hierarchy that both leads report into (in the extreme case, this is the CEO). Set up a meeting between the three of them. At the meeting, the two leads will present the one, correct decision that they have agreed upon. The executive will sit there, listen, and ratify it. [^1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[^1]<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926">What do executives do, anyway?</a></p>
<h1>Budgeting</h1>
<p>As an engineering leader you're faced with two 'human capital' measurement problems,</p>
<ol>
<li>Where is your engineering time going</li>
<li>Why can't you get more done</li>
</ol>
<p>Having a framework in place prior to challenges gives you and your team agency in the discussion. To drive Strategic Planning, Team Alignment and Prioritization, and Transparency bucket the work into 4 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required investments - “minimum tasks to maintain the current level of service in the eyes of our customers”.
<ul>
<li>Keep the lights on (KTLO) (Note this percentage comes 'off the top' based on the needs and health of your business)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elective investments
<ul>
<li>Build new stuff (for customers) ~60%</li>
<li>Improve existing stuff (for customers) ~20%</li>
<li>Increase your productivity (not customer visible) ~20%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-planning-(annual)" tabindex="-1">Strategic Planning (Annual) <a class="heading-anchor" href="#strategic-planning-(annual)">#</a></h2>
<p>At this level you're looking to align the right balance for the company for the coming year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss previous allocation</li>
<li>Key points about what got done and what didn't (against goals)</li>
<li>Propose allocations for the coming year</li>
<li>Highlight changes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="group-and-team-(quarterly)" tabindex="-1">Group and Team (Quarterly) <a class="heading-anchor" href="#group-and-team-(quarterly)">#</a></h2>
<p>To have traction, the framework can’t appear at annual planning and disappear for the rest of the year. Ask teams to report on their allocation across these buckets on a quarterly basis. Collected by engineering directors, expected vs. actual allocation in the previous quarter, and the expectation for next quarter. Read out by Program Management.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Strategic Planning</h1>
<p>As a functional leader you’ll be expected to set your own direction with little direction from others.</p>
<ul>
<li>When things in your area are going poorly, you’ll be swamped with more direction and input than you can readily absorb</li>
<li>when things are going well, you’ll often be responsible for supplying your own direction and that for your team.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t supply it yourself, you’ll start to feel the pull of irrelevance: maybe no one really cares what we do?</p>
<p>Cast a net:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks at your company what their previous companies did well</li>
<li>Draw ideas out from your team</li>
<li>Read technical papers</li>
<li>Meet with peers and ask them what they are doing</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Make time to plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take care of your own needs</li>
<li>Make time by choosing not to do some work. Be clear about this choice.</li>
<li>Block time to do planning, plan for energy, turn off notifications, work offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wish list. Make a list of things you’d like to be true in 6, 12, or 24 months. These could be aspects of the team’s process, quality targets, or product capabilities. Then pick one and work backwards to uncover how you might achieve such an outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worry list. Imagine that you quit big picture thinking and make no strategic plans. What are the biggest problems you’ll face in a year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to the future. Look back and consider being able to change past decisions and directions. What if we didn’t build X? What do we wish we had done differently? What would you do if you were starting fresh? These can be good clues to explore for shaping the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10x. Apply order of magnitude changes as a thinking tool to identify interesting leverage points. What if the service was 10x faster or 10x more efficient? What if we had 10x the traffic, data, or users?</p>
